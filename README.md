# RimWorld-Hydroponics-Expanded

[![Hydroponics Expanded Banner][banner]][workshop-link]

Provides simple but powerful hydroponics that store plants underground at the cost of expensive components, lots of
power, and research.

---

This mod is an expansion of the relatively unchanged [Hydroponics Basin][hydroponics-basin] for [RimWorld][rimworld].

Compared to most mods in the RimWorld community, this may be somewhat overpowered, but I did my best to make it
expensive both in resources & power usage.

## Features

- Compact Hydroponics for growing many plants in a small space.
- Balanced recipes with absurd power/recipe requirements for absurd density.
- Simple usage with relatively no changes compared to traditional Hydroponics.
- Strong compatability with few changes to Vanilla RimWorld.

## Compatibility

This mod does not modify any core vanilla code or Defs, and only builds off of them.
Therefore, other mods should have no problem with Hydroponics Expanded.

That said, mods that add custom crops may have issues - especially if they have custom growth mechanics.
A good example is a crop that, when harvested, does not get deleted. Typical hydroponic-grown crops in Vanilla RimWorld
get deleted when harvested, and thus work fine. Trees however, are not, and do not get deleted once harvested.

You can expect any crops like this to not work well within the basins added by Hydroponics Expanded.

Feel free to provide details on what crops fail to grow properly, and I can provide patches, even if it's simply
preventing the crop from being sown in the hydroponics in the first place (there is only so much I can do, after all).
