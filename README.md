# RimWorld-Hydroponics-Expanded

This mod is an expansion of the relatively unchanged [Hydroponics Basin][hydroponics-basin] for [RimWorld][rimworld].

This mod is not meant to be perfectly balanced, but it is meant to be more balanced and more expensive than what came before.

## Features

- Compact Hydroponics for growing many plants in a small space.
- Balanced recipes with absurd power/recipe requirements for absurd density.
- Simple usage with relatively no changes compared to traditional Hydroponics.
